Modeling with systems of differential equations requires prior
knowledge to create a fully specified model reflecting our understanding
of biological systems. In cases where we only have a partial understanding 
of the biological system but time series data of our variables of interest,
universal differential equations can be used where multilayer perceptron models
can be inserted into the equation and trained to account for the unknown 
interactions between variables. While producing good fits to data, trained MLPs
are a black box model leaving little to be interpreted. Kolmogorov Arnold Networks 
are a promising alternative to MLPs which can be combined with symbolic regression
to recover symbolic relationships between inputs and outputs. In this poster we build
upon work by Koenig, Kim, and Deng 2024 to show that replacing MLPs with a kolmogorov
arnold network in universal differential equations can be used to recover hidden terms
in a predator-prey model.
